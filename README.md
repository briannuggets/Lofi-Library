# Lofi Library - Habit Tracking Game

Lofi Library is a 2D pixel art habit tracking game developed in Unity. The game incorporates the concept of the Pomodoro Technique to help users develop positive habits while creating an engaging and immersive experience. By completing timed cycles, players can unlock rewards such as music sheets, pets, and equipment to enhance their gameplay.

## Gameplay
1. Open the game: online support is not yet implemented, so players are not required to login.
2. Enter the Dungeon: Once in, players enter the dungeon where the habit tracking gameplay takes place.
3. Timer and Pomodoro Principle: A timer is displayed, following the principles of the Pomodoro Technique. Players focus on their tasks for a set period (e.g., 25 minutes), known as a "Pomodoro." After each Pomodoro, there is a short break (e.g., 5 minutes), and after completing a certain number of Pomodoros, there is a longer break (e.g., 15-30 minutes).
4. Unlock Rewards: As players complete cycles and accumulate rewards, they unlock music sheets, which add to the library of music that plays in the dungeon. Additionally, players can earn pets and other equipment that enhance their gameplay experience.
5. Track Habits: Players can track their habits and progress within the game, monitoring their performance over time.
